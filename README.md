# Palindrome

I Created a simple web application that uses the fs and http modules to validate if a string is a palindrome server side.
A palindrome is a word or sentence that reads the same forward as it does backward.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node js

In this web application I was tasked with making a palindrome checke. The methods I used were .split() .reverse() .join(). I also used an api to to call thoes methods on the input value to check if what was entered was actually a palodrome .  

## Lessons Learned:

The things that I learned when building this application was the client side code is what the user can see and interact with and server side code is the behind the scenes and the algerium communicate with client side code. When both sides come together you have a full stack web application.
